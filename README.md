The Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Infrastructure: A
Comparative Analysis of Developed and Developing Countries 


PROBLEM DEFINITION 
The COVID-19 epidemic has had a big impact on healthcare systems around the world. This
study intends to investigate how the pandemic has impacted healthcare systems in
industrialized and developing nations. The research will concentrate on how COVID-19 has
affected hospitals, medical staff, and equipment, as well as how it has impacted the ability of
healthcare institutions to deliver services. The investigation will be guided by the following
inquiries: 
• How has the COVID-19 epidemic impacted both wealthy and developing nations'
healthcare systems? 
• How would COVID-19 affect the availability of medical supplies and personnel in both
developed and poor nations? 
• How have the healthcare systems in developed and developing nations reacted to the
pandemic, and how well did they handle the situation? 


BACKGROUND 
The COVID-19 epidemic has put a lot of strain on the world's healthcare systems, resulting in
overcrowded hospitals, a lack of medical supplies, and serious health concerns for healthcare
personnel. The influence of the pandemic on the healthcare infrastructure in both developed
and developing countries will be investigated in this study using academic and non-academic
publications, research articles, and government publications. The research will uncover
important themes and trends linked to healthcare infrastructure during the pandemic through
an examination of the literature.  
Findings from the literature review
A good literature review was carried out. The following data, articles, and papers have been
analyzed over 2 years period (2020-2021). Key findings observed from the publication have
been mentioned below.
• Owid-covid-data.csv [1]:
The data which was raw data collected from all over the world contained various attributes
in terms of COVID-19. The data is then processed into structured data. 

• World health organization (2021) [2]:
The website consists of various diseases from all over the world. The findings from this
website were global health observatory (GHO) data. The articles picked from this webpage
are the infrastructure of different healthcare centers around the world.

• Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on outpatient visits: A cross-sectional study of a large
integrated health care organization (2020). [3]:
Authors:  Dasgupta, S., & Bowen, K. J.
Journal:  The American Journal of Managed Care, 26(7), e207-e212.
The main aim of this paper was to get feedback from patients from different health centers.
Those who have been discharged from the hospitals have their opinion about the facilities
provided by the health organization. Also, virtual consultation due to the spread of COVID
virus, lots of people go through online consultations.

Different established and developing nations have responded to the pandemic differently
in terms of their healthcare infrastructure. There has been a sizable increase in hospital
capacity, medical technology, and staff in developed nations. In comparison, the overflow
of patients has been difficult to manage in developing nations due to the lack of hospital
resources and space. According to a study by Hussain et al. (2021), developing nations'
healthcare systems need to be strengthened to handle upcoming pandemics.
 
PROPOSED METHOD. 
To examine the variations in the healthcare infrastructure across developed and developing
countries, the research will employ a comparative analytic approach. The data will be analyzed
using a combination of machine learning and descriptive statistics. For example, hospital beds
per capita, healthcare workers per capita, and the availability of medical equipment will all be
identified and summarised using descriptive statistics. Regression and clustering methods from
machine learning will be used to model the association between significant variables and the
effect of COVID-19 on the healthcare system. Using a clustering analysis, nations will be
grouped according to how they have responded to the pandemic and how their healthcare
systems differ from one another. To express the results clearly and effectively to various
stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public. The research
findings will be presented via graphs, charts, and maps.  
Data 
The "owid-covid-data.csv" dataset will be used in the study, and it contains data on the number
of COVID-19 cases, fatalities, and testing conducted globally since the start of 2020. The
context for the analysis will be provided by additional datasets, such as the "Global Health
Observatory Data Repository" from the World Health Organization. 

Research questions / Hypotheses 
We will test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted healthcare infrastructure
in both developed and developing countries.
Hypothesis 2: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the availability of medical equipment and
personnel in both developed and developing countries.
Hypothesis 3: Healthcare systems in both developed and developing countries have responded
to the pandemic, but their responses have been limited by the severity of the crisis... 
Feature Engineering 
We will develop metrics to measure the number of hospital beds, medical staff, and medical
equipment per capita, as well as the variations in healthcare infrastructure and its reaction to
the pandemic. We will also consider the effect of numerous elements on the ability of
healthcare systems to deal with the pandemic, including population density, economic
indicators,
 
Data processing
The pre-processing of the data will involve cleaning and filling in any missing values. If there
are any uncertainties in the data, it is either drop down or modified into average value.
Exploratory data analysis will be carried out to find any patterns or trends in the data.
 
Modelling 
Regression and clustering are only two examples of machine learning models that will be used
to analyze the data and evaluate the assumptions. Visualization techniques will also be used to
present the findings clearly and more easily for a non-data science to understand.
